Automation – Urban Routes App
Project Overview

This project focuses on automated testing of the Urban Routes taxi application, covering the user registration and reservation booking flow. The objective is to validate critical user journeys and ensure application reliability through automated regression testing.

Scope of Testing

User registration workflow

Reservation and booking process

Input field validation

Regression testing of critical user flows

Testing Approach

The automation framework is implemented using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to improve test maintainability, scalability, and readability. Test cases cover both positive and negative scenarios for key functionalities.

Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Automation Framework: Selenium WebDriver

Test Framework: Pytest

Design Pattern: Page Object Model (POM)

Key Responsibilities

Designed and developed automated test scripts from scratch using Selenium and Pytest.

Implemented Page Object Model to structure test automation.

Executed automated regression tests for registration and reservation workflows.

Identified and documented defects during testing cycles.

Impact

Reduced test execution time to approximately one hour for validating critical user flows.

Minimized human errors during repetitive validation processes.

Created a reusable automation test suite for future regression cycles.

How to Run the Tests
